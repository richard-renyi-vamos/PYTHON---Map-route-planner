Here's an example of a basic map route planner app in Python using the folium library for map visualization and geopy for geocoding. This app will allow you to input start and destination addresses and display the route on a map.

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have these Python libraries installed:

folium: for map visualization
geopy: for geocoding addresses
requests: for using APIs (if needed for routing)
bash
Copy code
pip install folium geopy requests
Step 2: Implement the Code
python
Copy code
import folium
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
from geopy.distance import geodesic

def get_coordinates(address):
    """Get latitude and longitude for a given address."""
    geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="map_route_planner")
    location = geolocator.geocode(address)
    if location:
        return location.latitude, location.longitude
    else:
        print(f"Could not find the location: {address}")
        return None

def plot_route(start_coords, end_coords):
    """Create a map with the route from start to end."""
    # Create a map centered at the midpoint between start and end
    midpoint = ((start_coords[0] + end_coords[0]) / 2, 
                (start_coords[1] + end_coords[1]) / 2)
    route_map = folium.Map(location=midpoint, zoom_start=13)
    
    # Add markers for start and destination
    folium.Marker(location=start_coords, popup="Start", icon=folium.Icon(color="green")).add_to(route_map)
    folium.Marker(location=end_coords, popup="Destination", icon=folium.Icon(color="red")).add_to(route_map)
    
    # Draw a line between the two points
    folium.PolyLine([start_coords, end_coords], color="blue", weight=5).add_to(route_map)
    
    # Save the map to an HTML file
    route_map.save("route_map.html")
    print("Map has been created! Open 'route_map.html' to view the route.")

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Python Map Route Planner!")
    
    # Get input addresses
    start_address = input("Enter the starting address: ")
    end_address = input("Enter the destination address: ")
    
    # Get coordinates for the addresses
    start_coords = get_coordinates(start_address)
    end_coords = get_coordinates(end_address)
    
    if start_coords and end_coords:
        # Calculate and display the distance
        distance = geodesic(start_coords, end_coords).kilometers
        print(f"The distance between the two locations is approximately {distance:.2f} km.")
        
        # Plot the route
        plot_route(start_coords, end_coords)
    else:
        print("Unable to create the route due to invalid addresses.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
How It Works
The app uses geopy to convert addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates.
It calculates the straight-line distance (not detailed routes).
It uses folium to create an interactive map and save it as an HTML file.
The map includes markers for the start and destination and a line connecting them.
How to Use
Run the script.
Enter the starting and destination addresses.
Open the generated route_map.html file in your browser to see the route.
If you'd like to extend this app to include detailed driving/walking routes, you can integrate a routing API like Google Maps or OpenRouteService. Let me know if you need help with that! üåçüìçüí°
